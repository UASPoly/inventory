Designing a comprehensive database schema for a rental management system involves defining tables, relationships, and attributes to store essential information about properties, tenants, lease agreements, and other relevant data. Below is a simplified example of a database schema for this project:

Tables:

Property Table:

PropertyID (Primary Key)
Address
Size
Features
RentalPrice
Tenant Table:

TenantID (Primary Key)
FirstName
LastName
ContactNumber
Email
EmploymentDetails
Lease Agreement Table:

LeaseID (Primary Key)
PropertyID (Foreign Key referencing Property Table)
TenantID (Foreign Key referencing Tenant Table)
RentAmount
LeaseDuration
SecurityDeposit
LeaseStartDate
LeaseEndDate
Maintenance Request Table:

RequestID (Primary Key)
PropertyID (Foreign Key referencing Property Table)
TenantID (Foreign Key referencing Tenant Table)
RequestDate
Description
Status (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
Financial Transactions Table:

TransactionID (Primary Key)
LeaseID (Foreign Key referencing Lease Agreement Table)
TransactionDate
Amount
Type (Rent Payment, Expense, Security Deposit, etc.)
Communication Log Table:

LogID (Primary Key)
PropertyID (Foreign Key referencing Property Table)
TenantID (Foreign Key referencing Tenant Table)
LogDate
CommunicationType (Email, Letter, Note)
Content
Relationships:

One Property can have multiple Lease Agreements (one-to-many relationship).
One Tenant can have multiple Lease Agreements (one-to-many relationship).
One Lease Agreement corresponds to one Property and one Tenant (many-to-one relationships).
One Property can have multiple Maintenance Requests (one-to-many relationship).
One Tenant can submit multiple Maintenance Requests (one-to-many relationship).
One Lease Agreement can have multiple Financial Transactions (one-to-many relationship).
One Property can have multiple Communication Logs (one-to-many relationship).
One Tenant can have multiple Communication Logs (one-to-many relationship).


#Software funtional requirement#

Functional requirements define the specific functionalities and features that the rental management system must possess to meet the needs of users and achieve its objectives. Here are key functional requirements for the rental management system:

User Authentication and Authorization:

The system should have secure user authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users, such as property owners, tenants, and administrators, can access specific functionalities.
Property Listing:

Property owners should be able to easily list and advertise their rental properties on the platform. This includes providing details such as property address, size, features, and rental price.
Tenant Application Management:

The system should allow tenants to submit online applications for rental properties. Property owners or administrators should be able to review and manage these applications efficiently.
Lease Agreement Management:

The system must support the creation, storage, and management of digital lease agreements. This includes specifying rental terms, lease duration, security deposit, and any property-specific rules or restrictions.
Tenant Information Management:

The system should maintain a comprehensive database of tenant information, including contact details, employment history, references, and a history of previous leases.
Maintenance Request Handling:

Tenants should be able to submit maintenance requests through the system, specifying the nature of the request. Property owners or maintenance personnel should have a tool to track, prioritize, and update the status of these requests.
Rent Payment Processing:

The system must facilitate rent payments, allowing tenants to make online payments. It should generate receipts and track payment histories. Property owners should be able to view and manage rent payments easily.
Communication and Notifications:

The system should support communication between property owners and tenants. Automated notifications, such as lease renewal reminders or maintenance updates, should be sent to relevant parties.
Reporting and Analytics:

The system should provide reporting capabilities, allowing property owners and administrators to generate reports on financial transactions, property occupancy rates, and other relevant metrics.
Document Management:

A centralized repository for storing and managing important documents, including lease agreements, maintenance records, and legal documents, should be part of the system.
User Roles and Permissions:

Different user roles (e.g., property owner, tenant, administrator) should have distinct permissions to access and perform specific actions within the system.
Search and Filter Functionality:

The system should have robust search and filter features to help users easily find specific properties, tenant information, or transaction records.
